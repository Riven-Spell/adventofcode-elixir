# Advent of Code (Elixir)

Currently, all that lays in this repo is solutions, and a very unfinished framework for downloading/generating inputs, and running already written days.

Working out of iex is simple. Specify your advent of code auth token in `AOC_SESSION` to download inputs. The `AdventOfCode` module provides for grappling around the project structure using the available functions to grab modules for different days, pull the module & input for the current day, etc.

Input generation does not work whatsoever yet.
